In exercise 1 we start by loading the file content by using the same code as the test load and store them in an array A. 
Then we use the insertion sort to organize the numbers in the array which is what the insertionSort function duos. 
Insertion sort loops through the array and for each element it loops backwards from it's spot to find the appropriate. 

To compile the program we used CMakeLists.txt:
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.17)
   project(Lab2SM_Clion C)

   set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 11)

add_executable(exercise1
