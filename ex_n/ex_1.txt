insertion_sort implements the Insertion sort algorithm. It contains
the function insertionSort function which sorts an array using the
insertion sort method.

In exercise 1 we start by loading the file content by using the same code as the test load and store them in an array
"a".
Then we use the insertion sort to organize the numbers in the array.
Insertion sort loops through the array and for each element it loops backwards from it's spot to find the appropriate
new spot.

To compile the program we used CMakeLists.txt:
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.17)
    project(Lab2SM_Clion C)

    set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 11)

    add_executable(exercise1
        src/tests/exercise1.c
        src/load_files/load_file.h
        src/load_files/load_file.c
        src/list/list.c
        src/list/list.h
        src/insertion_sort/insertion_sort.c
        src/insertion_sort/insertion_sort.h
        src/console/console.c
        src/console/console.h)

To run the program we need to pass the file path to a sorting problem:
    On windows we used Command Prompt:
        start exercise1.exe [filepath]
